The species with ACE2 sequences most closely related to that of the "Flying Fox" (in order of least nodes between closest common ancestor, although they all share a common ancestor that no other living species does) "Pteropus lylei," are: "Syconycteris australis" with one node; "Dobsonia viridis" with two nodes; "Cynopterus sphinx" with three nodes; and "Epomophorus wahlbergi," as well as "Rousettus leschenaultii," with 4 nodes.

Given the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 jumped from fruit bats like the flying fox to some intermediary species—by means of exploiting similarities in their Angiotenin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to employ it as a celllular entry receptor—and then moved on to humans, following the phylogeny of these species to find potential culprits along different branches of their evolutionary tree could prove effective when epidemiologic efforts have fallen short.
