19.) To learn more about the Japanese medaka's lce (low choriolytic enzyme precursor) gene (associated to the transcript NM_001104822), a good publication to read on Pubmed is "Isolation of cDNAs for LCE and HCE, two constituent proteases of the hatching enzyme of Oryzias latipes, and concurrent expression of their mRNAs during development" by Yasumasu et al. (1992).
